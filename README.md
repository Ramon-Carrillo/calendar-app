# Calendar App

Weekly calendar app, a user can add, delete, and edit day to day events within a week. Each
event corresponds to a particular task/to-do item that the user would like to keep track of.

Used a generic approach for developing an app from scratch:

1. Build a static version of the app
2. Break the app into components
3. Hard-code initial states with parent-child data flow
4. Create state mutations (and accompanying component dispatchers)
